%%Nonlinear Constraints
%Nonlinear inequality constraints have the form c(x) â‰¤ 0, where c is a 
%vector of constraints, one component for each constraint. 
%Similarly, nonlinear equality constraints have the form ceq(x) = 0. 
%   G1 is the gain of the length of the first leg 
%   G2 is the gain of the length of the second leg 
%   G3 is the gain of the length of the third leg 
%   g2 is the rotation angle from the direction of leg 2
%   g3 is the rotation angle from the direction of leg 3
%   k3 is the regression angle in leg 3
%   sigma is the standard deviation for the Gaussian distribution of the return point
%   nu is the xxx
%   DX is a cell structure containing the segment of each trial
%   THETAX is the turning angle (wrong at the moment)
%   X is the data points
%   OoBLen is the Out-of-Boundary length with 0 for non-oob trials, >0 for oob trials.
%   flagOoB is the flag of Out-of-Boundary trials, with 0 non-OoB trials 1 those OoB trials
