Generative Linear-Angular Model of Path Integration (GLAMPI)  
======

[Figure 1]: https://github.com/Lenakeiz/VectorAdditionModel/blob/main/Images/Fig1a.png "Triangle Completion Task"

## Description 
This repository contains the full dataset and the scripts for generating the analysis and the figures from _"Dissociating linear and angular path integration in ageing and Alzheimerâ€™s disease"_[^1]  
The anonymised dataset for healthy elderly and MCI patients is the one from the _"Differentiation of mild cognitive impairment using an entorhinal cortex-based test of virtual reality navigation"_[^2]

## Installation
Simply clone the repository anywhere in your machine. Make sure to add the folders and subfolders to the Matlab path.

## Package dependency
Developed using Matlab R2022a.

Requires the following MATLAB toolboxes:

- [Statistics and machine learning](https://uk.mathworks.com/products/statistics.html)
- [Optimization Toolbox](https://uk.mathworks.com/products/optimization.html)
- [Mapping toolbox](https://uk.mathworks.com/products/mapping.html)

We also used a customised version of [Rob Campbell (2023) sigstar](https://github.com/raacampbell/sigstar) which is included already in the project files.

## Use
Scripts to reproduce the plots and analysis in the paper can be found into the **Main** folder. Each of the scripts produce an entire or a single plot from any given figure of the paper. Each script is named accordingly to the figure ouput. Usually plots will not be displayed in Matlab but output will be saved inside **Output** folder. Some scripts will take longer than others to run (like the one that runs all different types of model).
